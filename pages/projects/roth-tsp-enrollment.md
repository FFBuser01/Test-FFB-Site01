## What is the issue?

The financial readiness of our military Servicemembers and their families is a priority of the Department of Defense (DOD). The military, like the civilian Federal government, offers a workplace savings plan called the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to help Servicemembers save and invest for their futures. However, just 42 percent of active duty Servicemembers are enrolled in TSP, compared to 87 percent of civilian Federal employees.
